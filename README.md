# Plover Polish Slowik plugin

(in construction)

## Intro

I begin to work on Polish plugin for Plover.

I have been working on the Polish stenotype theory for some time (with long breaks). 

But I got nowhere. 

I didn't have enough willpower to make a final decision about the keyboard layout.

Fortunately, the project of creating a Polish steno-theory was taken over by Priscilla Trillo and she became the main brain. 

So it was left for me to develop a plugin that could be added to the Plover resources after the theory was completed.


## Installation


To install from locally cloned git repository, you can run the following command:

### Install on Windows

```Powershell

    cd "<path-to-plover-plugin>"
    "<path-to-plover*>\plover_console.exe" -s plover_plugins install -e .
    
    *"C:\Program Files\Open Steno Project\Plover 4.0.0.dev9+65.gdf65bf1\plover_console.exe"
```

### Install on Linux

```bash

    cd <path_to_plugin directory>
    plover -s plover_plugins install -e .

```


## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Mirabai Knight for creating Plover.

Many thanks to the developers of this software for keeping it still available. Especially to Joshua Lifton, Hesky Fisher, Ted Morin, Pierre Benoit and others that I will not mention them by name as they are known to Plover users.
