# plover_polish_slowik
I begin to work on Polish plugin for Plover.

I have been working on the Polish stenotype theory for some time (with long breaks). But I got nowhere. 
I didn't have enough willpower to make a final decision about the keyboard layout.

Fortunately, the project of creating a Polish steno-theory was taken over by Priscilla Trillo and she became the main brain. 
So it was left for me to develop a plugin that could be added to the Plover resources after the theory was completed.
